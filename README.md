- Group Presentation - Money Laundering: A Hidden Financial Crime
This presentation explored the concept of money laundering, its methods, stages, and real-world impact on global economies. As a group, we researched and explained how illicit funds are disguised as legitimate income, discussed legal frameworks used to combat money laundering, and highlighted notable case studies. Our goal was to raise awareness of this financial crime and its consequences through clear, informative visuals and collaborative analysis.
