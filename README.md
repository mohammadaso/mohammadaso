  - Web Design - 7M A.I.
    This is a concept for a dynamic AI-powered website assistant that adapts its communication style based on user input.

*Key Features (Planned):*

- Customizable Persona: Users can specify the personality or role the AI should take (e.g., ‚ÄúTalk to me like a doctor‚Äù).

- Natural Language Interaction: The assistant responds in a conversational, human-like manner tailored to the chosen persona.

- Web-Based Interface: Clean and user-friendly design accessible from any browser.

- Modular Design: Easily extendable for adding more personas or specialized functions in the future.
